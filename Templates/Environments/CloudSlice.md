<summary title="Select to expand">Understanding a Cloud Slice</summary>

- Your Challenge Lab is using a cloud slice that reflects a dynamic, constantly evolving cloud environment. A cloud slice is a subset of a cloud platform subscription that has been assigned to a user account which was provisioned for you to use for the duration of this Challenge Lab. It provides temporary access to a subset of resources available in a cloud subscription so that you can learn the concepts without having to configure your own subscription. A cloud slice has restrictions on the types of administrative activities that are allowed. 

- As you complete your Challenge Lab, you may find that the provided guidance is not identical to what you encounter in your cloud slice environment. If you encounter a difference between your cloud slice and the Challenge Lab instructions, please let us know by submitting feedback directly to <a href="https://supportrequest.learnondemandsystems.com/sf.php?s=123formbuilder-5553155&control66068515=@Lab.User.Email&control66068522=@Lab.LabInstance.Id&control66608830=@Lab.LabProfile.Id&control66068513=@lab.User.FirstName&control66068514=@lab.User.LastName&control66068517=@lab.User.Organization.Name" title="Challenge Lab feedback" id="lab-feedback-custom-url">Challenge Labs feedback</a> so that we may update the content in as timely a manner as possible.
